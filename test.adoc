ZFS Performance Tips
****
ZFS uses a lot of memory, so it is best to add additional 8-16GB RAM
if you want to use ZFS.

.Use fast SSD as write cache

ZFS provides the feature to use a fast SSD drive as write cache. The
write cache is called the ZFS Intent Log (ZIL). You can add that after
installation using the following command:

 zpool add <pool-name> log </dev/path_to_fast_ssd>
